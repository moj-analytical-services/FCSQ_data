# FCSQ_data
Updated April 2021.

This repository will be used for the data processing needed for the FCSQ publication. The [FCS_RAP](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/FCS_RAP) repository contains the code for creating the bulletin. [fcsrap](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/fcsrap) is a package to contain any functions needed.

The code found in this project currently splits into two areas:
1. Code for creating the CSVs from the FamilyMan data on the Analytical Platform
2. Code for creating the published tables from the CSVs

All areas are works in progress, and have not yet been used towards a live run of FCSQ.

The [wiki](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/FCSQ_data/wiki) contains information on:
- Setting up your version of the repo
- An overview of the process in the code
